# Project 04 - Inhabitent

Inhabitent is a site that utilizes WordPress as a CMS (Content Management System) that contains a blog, journal, and an online shop for camping and outdoor supplies.

## Installation

### 1. Download

Then add me to your `wp-content` directory.

### 2. Rename the `Inhabitent` directory

Make sure that the theme directory name is project appropriate!

### 3. Install the all dependencies

Next you'll need to run `npm install` **inside your theme directory** next to install the node modules you'll need for Gulp, etc.

### 4. Update the proxy in `gulpfile.js`

Lastly, be sure to update your `gulpfile.js` with the appropriate URL for the Browsersync proxy (so change `inhabitent.dev` to the appropriate localhost URL).
